# Modified-DynaSLAM-With-YOLO-DOT

DynaSLAM is a visual SLAM system that is robust in dynamic scenarios for monocular, stereo and RGB-D configurations. Having a static map of the scene allows inpainting the frame background that has been occluded by such dynamic objects.

Based on the work of DynaSLAM, we change the moving object detector with YOLOv4 and use our dynamic object tracking (algorithm) to get and even faster and more accurate results.

We provide examples to run the SLAM system in the [TUM dataset](http://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/doku.php?id=kmavvisualinertialdatasets) as monocular.

## Prerequisites
- We have tested the system in **Ubuntu 18.04** and **20.04**
- gcc >= 7.4.0
- OpenCV >= 3.4.5
- Install ORB-SLAM2 prerequisites: C++11 or C++0x Compiler, Pangolin, OpenCV and Eigen3  (https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2)
- Install boost libraries with the command `sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev`.
- Install python 2.7, keras and tensorflow

## Getting Started
- Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/llee628/Modified-DynaSLAM-With-YOLO-DOT.git
```
```
cd Modified-DynaSLAM-With-YOLO-DOT
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```
## RGB-D Example on TUM Dataset
- Download a sequence from http://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/rgbd-dataset/download and uncompress it.

- Associate RGB images and depth images executing the python script [associate.py](http://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/rgbd-dataset/tools):

  ```
  python associate.py PATH_TO_SEQUENCE/rgb.txt PATH_TO_SEQUENCE/depth.txt > associations.txt
  ```
These associations files are given in the folder `./Examples/RGB-D/associations/` for the TUM dynamic sequences.

- Execute the following command. Change `TUMX.yaml` to TUM1.yaml,TUM2.yaml or TUM3.yaml for freiburg1, freiburg2 and freiburg3 sequences respectively. Change `PATH_TO_SEQUENCE_FOLDER` to the uncompressed sequence folder. Change `ASSOCIATIONS_FILE` to the path to the corresponding associations file. `PATH_TO_MASKS` and `PATH_TO_OUTPUT` are optional parameters.

  ```
  ./Examples/RGB-D/rgbd_tum Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt Examples/RGB-D/TUMX.yaml PATH_TO_SEQUENCE_FOLDER ASSOCIATIONS_FILE (PATH_TO_MASKS) (PATH_TO_OUTPUT)
  ```
  
If `PATH_TO_MASKS` and `PATH_TO_OUTPUT` are **not** provided, only the geometrical approach is used to detect dynamic objects. 

If `PATH_TO_MASKS` is provided, Mask R-CNN is used to segment the potential dynamic content of every frame. These masks are saved in the provided folder `PATH_TO_MASKS`. If this argument is `no_save`, the masks are used but not saved. If it finds the Mask R-CNN computed dynamic masks in `PATH_TO_MASKS`, it uses them but does not compute them again.

If `PATH_TO_OUTPUT` is provided, the inpainted frames are computed and saved in `PATH_TO_OUTPUT`.

## Stereo Example on KITTI Dataset
- Download the dataset (grayscale images) from http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_odometry.php 

- Execute the following command. Change `KITTIX.yaml`to KITTI00-02.yaml, KITTI03.yaml or KITTI04-12.yaml for sequence 0 to 2, 3, and 4 to 12 respectively. Change `PATH_TO_DATASET_FOLDER` to the uncompressed dataset folder. Change `SEQUENCE_NUMBER` to 00, 01, 02,.., 11. By providing the last argument `PATH_TO_MASKS`, dynamic objects are detected with Mask R-CNN.
```
./Examples/Stereo/stereo_kitti Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt Examples/Stereo/KITTIX.yaml PATH_TO_DATASET_FOLDER/dataset/sequences/SEQUENCE_NUMBER (PATH_TO_MASKS)
```

## Monocular Example on TUM Dataset
- Download a sequence from http://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/rgbd-dataset/download and uncompress it.

- Execute the following command. Change `TUMX.yaml` to TUM1.yaml,TUM2.yaml or TUM3.yaml for freiburg1, freiburg2 and freiburg3 sequences respectively. Change `PATH_TO_SEQUENCE_FOLDER`to the uncompressed sequence folder. By providing the last argument `PATH_TO_MASKS`, dynamic objects are detected with Mask R-CNN.
```
./Examples/Monocular/mono_tum Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt Examples/Monocular/TUMX.yaml PATH_TO_SEQUENCE_FOLDER (PATH_TO_MASKS)
```

## Monocular Example on KITTI Dataset
- Download the dataset (grayscale images) from http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_odometry.php 

- Execute the following command. Change `KITTIX.yaml`by KITTI00-02.yaml, KITTI03.yaml or KITTI04-12.yaml for sequence 0 to 2, 3, and 4 to 12 respectively. Change `PATH_TO_DATASET_FOLDER` to the uncompressed dataset folder. Change `SEQUENCE_NUMBER` to 00, 01, 02,.., 11. By providing the last argument `PATH_TO_MASKS`, dynamic objects are detected with Mask R-CNN.
```
./Examples/Monocular/mono_kitti Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt Examples/Monocular/KITTIX.yaml PATH_TO_DATASET_FOLDER/dataset/sequences/SEQUENCE_NUMBER (PATH_TO_MASKS)
```
